# Exercise 1 - Votes and Electors

This program calculates the percentage of valid, blank, and null votes based on the total number of electors.

It uses an `Election` class with the following methods:

- `null_percentage()`

## Example values:
- Total: 1000
- Valid: 800
- Blank: 150
- Null: 50

## How to run

python votes_electors.py
